It was suits, but she would never wear those suits out on a date with my father!", "I always envisioned myself having a traditional and elegant wedding.", "I think parental leave is enormously important - and it's a personal decision. Part of building a company whose goal is to empower women in all aspects of life is that I've given my team some leeway to determine what parental leave looks like for each of them individually.", "It's interesting, but because I have my own collection, I actually almost never purchase jewelry unless it's sort of playful, whimsical pieces that are more fashion, a little less investment-oriented. Most of my personal jewelry collection is from my own collection. The pieces that get layered in tend to be gifts from my husband.", "Whatever we do, whatever our backgrounds, we've all had some kind of advantage somewhere along the way. Some break that might have gone to someone else. Some edge or inside track we couldn't have counted on.", "No matter how different a career path we choose from our parents, people will always say we wouldn't have gotten there if it hadn't been for our name. And in the end, there's no way to tell if that's true or not. Maybe it's not the worst thing for people not to see you coming. If people want to underestimate me, I'm fine with that.", "You can be born into privilege, or you can not be born into privilege. You can be born into the opposite extreme and into poverty. I think from there on, though, you really do have to make your luck.", "Real change, the kind we have not seen in decades, is only going to come from outside the system. And it's only going to come from a man who's spent his entire life doing what others said could not be done.

I'd watch Czech cartoons.", "When Donald Trump is in charge, all that counts is ability, effort, and excellence. This has long been the philosophy at the Trump Organization.

Women are paid equally for the work that we do, and when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out.", "I'm not saying that if you're working at home, raising a family, that's not work.

That's almost the most basic thing one can do to assess them.", "If people think I'm just the boss's daughter, they're deceived.", "For my first fragrance, I wanted to capture the essence of a woman's strength and beauty.", "Running is a great metaphor for life. You set a goal, and then you get to work. How well you do is a direct reflection of how hard you work. It's a mental game, too. There are setbacks along the way, but the true test of a runner is how you overcome and push past them.", "I think my dad is highly gender-neutral. If he doesn't like someone, he'll articulate that, and I think it's also part of what resonates about him. He'll say what he's thinking.", "My diet has definitely become greener; however, I am a big proponent of everything in moderation.

It didn't work out.", "No matter what I hear about my parents, about my family, no matter what I read, the fact is that I'm absolutely proud to be a Trump. For a while, I was worried that for my whole life I'd sort of be under my parents' shadow, but it's not a bad shadow to be under.", "Me and my peers, we're working really hard at being moms and sisters and professionals.", "People talk about balance. Balance is an awful measure of things because it implies a scale that inevitably tips. I like to look through the filter of, 'Is the life I'm leading consistent with my priorities?'

There's always going to be someone else who's smarter than you, but there's no substitute for passion. People who are passionate always work the hardest, and that sets them apart.", "I spearhead interior design for all Trump projects.", "I'm a daughter, not a clone. So, of course, daughters often disagree with things their fathers say. But I share my viewpoints with him privately, not publicly. I'm not the candidate.", "Life is a marathon, not a sprint.

And long before it was commonplace, you also saw women.", "Thanks to my Czech-German heritage, I can't get enough of savory foods like stews, sausage, noodles, and anything that involves melted cheese.

They may be right.", "I started with jewelry when I was probably 24 years old. It was really just in response to a feeling that most of the fine jewelers were men appealing to men and selling pieces in a very unmodern way. I felt that there was a huge demographic of self-purchasing women who were feeling uncomfortable in the traditional retail environment.", "My mother taught me to appreciate a good drugstore beauty aisle. I regularly use Aquaphor, Chap Stick, Purpose Face Soap, and Aveeno body moisturizer.", "Are you asking for a raise? Do your research and know your market value. Having an informed sense of your worth, as dictated by the broader marketplace, will give you greater confidence in requesting increased compensation. It's tough to dispute someone who can back up her assertions with facts and a smart, articulate argument.", "I try to put out what I'm going to wear the night before. It just makes things a little bit more seamless in the mornings. There is definitely, you know, sort of a trusty work uniform - a chic, feminine dress that's easy and versatile.", "I tried a juice cleanse, and it was a total disaster. For the eight hours that I lasted, I felt like I was on the brink of starvation. For me, it's about making the right choices.", "I enjoy wearing fragrance every day and have found myself searching for the one signature scent that truly reflects my personality and the things I love, such as Bulgarian rose.

I have less time, so I'm a much more efficient decision maker.", "Know what you want to achieve prior to starting to negotiate. It's the golden rule but the one most people fail to heed. Without a plan, you allow the opposing party to define your goals instead of the other way around.", "I recently discovered Artkive, a wonderful app that allows you to archive your child's artwork and create cool gifts like photo albums, mugs, mousepads, etc. It's very easy to use, and since Arabella is such a talented artist, I'm a pro!", "I don't have a sweet tooth, normally; I'm a salty-savory girl. But when I'm pregnant, almost as a ritual, at 4 o'clock, I'll have cookies-and-cream ice cream!", "Basically, when I get home I just do emails for around three hours, which stinks.

I'm usually working from my laptop or my phone, desperately trying to get my inbox to zero before I fall asleep.", "If people think they can elicit from me whatever terms they want, they are mistaken.", "Pessimists are toxic. I love optimists - and by that, I don't mean people who are unable to see challenges. Optimists are solution-oriented.", "As president, my father will change the labor laws put in place when women were not a significant portion of the workforce. He will make childcare affordable and accessible to all. He will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this, too, right alongside of him.", "When you are in the public eye, it is really counterproductive to think about how you're viewed in the eyes of others.

I especially appreciate the presence of these women in traditionally male-dominated industries, such as real estate.", "I think it is bad luck to put shoes on a table or walk under ladders.", "I don't own a blow-dryer - I don't know how to use it. Most mornings, I walk to work with my hair wet.", "The way my father raised me was really informative of how I think about my role as a female and how I view myself in a professional and personal capacity. So he encouraged me to set the bar very high for myself, to set great goals for myself.", "Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career. He will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this, too, right along side of him.", "The reality is I have a closet full of shoes that I don't wear because they are not comfortable, and I am not going to be hobbling between meetings. There's nothing that ruins an entrance like somebody who's uncomfortable in their shoes.", "I can't imagine that I would be the person I am today if, over the last seven years, I had been married to somebody who didn't feel 100 percent comfortable with my drive, my ambition, my interest in thinking big and swinging for the fences.", "I try to live in the present. I learn from my mistakes in an effort not to repeat them, but I remain totally focused on today and tomorrow. Many of my mistakes turned out to be incredible opportunities for growth, both professionally and personally, and therefore, in hindsight, they were deeply valuable.", "My father not only has the strength and ability necessary to be our next president, but also the kindness and compassion that will enable him to be the leader that this country needs.", "People ask me, do I ever disagree with my father? It would be a little strange if I didn't.", "My mom grew up in the Soviet Bloc, and she was a Tiger Mom. We didn't get away with much.", "A word of advice: your interview is about you. It's not about the school you went to, what you majored in, what your GPA was, or who your parents happen to be or know. Most of that stuff is right on your resume, and it might even have gotten you into the room, but it won't get you much farther.", "A timeless piece of jewelry, like pearls or stud earrings, has lasting value.

It looks very different to be a working woman in other places in the world.", "Usually, if I can't fall asleep, you will find me catching up on a good book or zoning out with an episode of 'The Real Housewives.' I always have a couple books on my bedside table in various stages of completion.", "Instagram is my favorite! It's interactive and a fun way to stay connected to my friends, family and fans. I love posting photos from family trips, property visits, previews of my collections, everything!", "In both business and personal life, I've always found that travel inspires me more than anything else I do. Evidence of the languages, cultures, scenery, food, and design sensibilities that I discover all over the world can be found in every piece of my jewelry.", "I had very busy parents, but I really appreciated having a set of traditions during my own childhood, like consistently celebrating holidays at the same place.", "There are some areas of the world, and some areas in America, where people love full jewelry suites. That's never been something that I've gravitated toward, but I will create special collections for people who like that.", "My brothers and I early on said to one another that, as a collective, we could do far more than any of us could do individually.", "The more natural or eco-based products you can introduce into your beauty regimen, the more beneficial it is for your skin. It's similar to introducing organic food into your daily diet.", "The harder you work, the luckier you get.

No. It's cost you several hundred pounds because somebody else was willing to pay that much for it. If they weren't... it wouldn't.", "I think it's safe to say that 'manliness' was a common theme in my upbringing.

It's a tool for me; when you're an entrepreneur, and you're pulled in every direction, it is wonderful to have this discipline.", "Fashion is not art. Fashion is a business that requires discipline and attention to detail and very organized systems of logistics and operations and processes. But even with the most smoothly oiled machine to manage the business, without creativity, fashion could not exist.", "The most amazing thing about Karl Lagerfeld is that no matter what you ask him, you will always get an interesting answer. We even exchanged notes about ponytails.", "When you come through a business education, a lot of what they teach you is to make decisions through analysis, and logic and rationale, and I'm a big believer in that. But I also believe in the power of instinct. The truth is you're never going to have a perfect answer or view of how it is going to work.", "Growing up in Canada, I used to love a walk in the early morning, when the streets are quiet and the sun was shining. Walking in the morning is still very refreshing... and if I can, I will walk to my first meeting or appointment.", "I focus on projects I am passionate about and only work with people I respect. Without these supportive teams, partners and clients, I could never work on so many things. I am fortunate that they see the value in the multiplicity of my work and how it all comes together in a kind of virtuous cycle.", "Fashion is always seen as somewhat frivolous and self-indulgent. And I think people on the inside maybe don't see or understand how exciting and diverse a business it is.", "Not everyone can be successful selling fashion at $25,000 for a wedding outfit. Certain designers are able to do that. And there is only a certain amount of consumers who can do that. The real opportunity is in that $25 garment.", "It's not like I ever sat in my room and said I was going to start a media company and become an editor in chief. It was never my dream. It was something that just happened.", "In the daytime, I was studying at school and in the evenings, I was a stage kid. I was trained in theatre and public speaking. I was a really active kid.", "I had long had an instinct about there being a role for me in a creative industry. Maybe I didn't listen to that voice as much earlier on, but when it had become a deafening sound in my head I realised I had to go and explore it.", "I'm regularly speaking at London Business School and Harvard Business School. They're the next generation of leaders in the fashion industry.", "As much as technology has made me so much more efficient, enabling me to run a small but global company from where I happen to be, at times it feels like the technology is running me, as opposed to the other way round.", "Not every brand needs to be on every social platform. Brands should have a very strategic objective, whether it's marketing or commercial. The biggest mistake a brand can make is to be on a social platform without a plan or the resources to manage it.", "Combining technology and fashion shouldn't be about PR gimmicks - they should genuinely enhance the experience of buying, owning and experiencing a luxury product.", "I have always been drawn to fashion from an aesthetic and consumer standpoint. I honestly never thought that I could take my business training and apply it here. I worked in retail and was into fashion. It was something I liked, and people trusted my opinion.", "I usually have eight to 10 meetings a day and travel 150 days a year..._It sounds crazy, but I wouldn't have it any other way.", "I could have probably built a great career in management consulting, but one of the insights that I had early on is that just because you're good at something doesn't mean that you should continue to do it. Somewhere in my heart of hearts I knew it wasn't what I wanted to do."], "ian mcdiarmid": ["There were a number of people who helped me get there, and the one I always mention is Michael Byrne, the great master swordsman and brilliant stunt double.", "But he did say that the character would be on the sidelines in movies One and Two, and move into the middle with number Three, but I didn't realize he would move in with quite such a bang.", "When George asked me to be the prequels, it was the same kind of meeting - it was very short and to the point. It was nice to see him after a long time, and we met in a hotel room.", "That's the mark of a great storyteller, never to give away secrets in advance.", "If you got the DVD you can see that George Lucas has taken that person out, as well as the voice, and we shot this scene when we arrived in Australia during the actual filming of Episode 3.", "I suppose it's easy to play a hypocritical politician with a smiling face; it's also quite gratifying to play.", "I'm the blackest villain of all time.", "It was a scene I was really looking forward to, and one that I embraced, and when we were filming it, George got closer and closer and closer with that camera - he was practically up my nose for the final shot. So I knew it was a moment that I had to do my best to get right.", "The part that I think is one of the most interesting is of course the one that Hayden Christensen plays.", "Consistency is very important when you're making films.", "And also, it's sort of my job to make you believe things about him that aren't true about me.", "To start your life as a character of 120 years when you are in your late thirties, and then go back in time about 20 years later to play the same character who is your own age then, its very complicated, but very interesting.", "For me it's even more interesting, because my character comes out of the shadow. It's a chance to really act emotionally, because the situation is an extreme one."], "irving layton": ["Conscience: self-esteem with a halo.", "I am a genius who has written poems that will survive with the best of Shakespeare, Wordsworth and Keats.", "My neighbor doesn't want to be loved as much as he wants to be envied.", "Idealist: a cynic in the making.", "When you argue with your inferiors, you convince them of only one thing: they are as clever as you.", "In Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Canada has at last produced a political leader worthy of assassination.", "Canadians look down on the United States and consider it Hell.

Canada is to the United States what, in Dante's scheme, Limbo is to Hell.", "We love in another's soul whatever of ourselves we can deposit in it; the greater the deposit, the greater the love."], "ian holm": ["'Whatever it takes' is my opinion of method acting and, indeed, any other kind of acting. Look at Brando and De Niro. But it's not my cup of tea.", "I get a lot of fan mail addressed to Bilbo and sometimes Sir Bilbo - it's hardly ever addressed to Ian Holm, in fact. My business manager drafts the replies, and then I pop in to the office and sign them, 'Bilbo!'", "All performances are different. I don't think it's necessary to compare one with another. I am just me playing the role of Lear. You're bound to get a Holm approach to it, whatever that may be. I just got out there and did it. I'm very much a doer in my acting.", "As an actor, I'm very much a company person. And this also goes through my life: I have a dread of responsibility. I like someone else to be in charge.", "The most important thing in the face is the eyes, and if you can make the eyes talk, you're halfway there.", "Scarlett Johansson was wonderful in 'Lost in Translation,' and then, seemingly within a couple of weeks, she became completely Hollywoodised. I was shocked. I didn't recognise her. I hope to God it's just a phase.", "It's not easy to shout against real elements. The elements are big, and the human voice is very small.", "If everyone's ready for a shot to start, except for one actor who's intent on getting to the bottom of their soul, it can be a bit annoying.", "I grew up with the great Sir Laurence Olivier, and I think it's fair to say that a lot of actors of my age were influenced by his very individual vocal delivery. He was a showman who would always play to the gallery."], "ichiro suzuki": ["I want to keep playing until I am at least 50.", "I think there's sexiness in infield hits because they require technique.", "You should seek approval from yourself.", "My father was just an amateur; my mother is not even an athlete herself.", "I feel like I should be more in touch with the nuances of this game.", "When I think about it, if somebody was to pass Pete Rose's record just playing in Japan, that would be a bigger accomplishment because of the few games they play over there.", "I collect autographed major-league baseballs.", "I was kind of influenced by the hip-hop culture.", "Personally, I don't like the term 'success.' It's too arbitrary and too relative a thing. It's usually someone else's definition, not yours.", "The more that Japanese players go to the big leagues to play and succeed, the more that will serve to inspire young kids in Japan to want to become baseball players when they grow up.", "I've made far too many mistakes. That's the way I feel.", "If I ever saw myself saying I'm excited going to Cleveland, I'd punch myself in the face because I'm lying.", "I think, mentally, you sometimes need a break. But for me, my body is built so that if I don't work out, that's when I put more stress on my body and get more tired.", "It's very tough for a ballplayer to get proud and keep his dignity.", "I heard that in the United States the level of baseball was the highest in the world. So it was only natural that I would want to go there, as a baseball player.", "The Japanese have a strong tendency to suppress their own feelings. That's the Japanese character.

I wouldn't be true to the task if I responded in my unrefined English.", "Seattle has always been home.", "There is nothing I will miss about Japanese baseball. Off the field, I will miss my dog.", "I believe that, as an athlete, how you got to the age of 42 makes a big difference. I have learned about my body; I haven't gone off only talent until I was 42.", "We have to connect to our fans through the media, and when you talk about that, it's got to come from your heart. And when it comes from your heart, it has to be absolutely consistent. There's a big risk you take without an interpreter because, as professional baseball players, we are here to perform baseball, not to learn a language.", "For me, if I stay on the couch all day - or even one day - I'll be more tired doing that than going out and giving my body a workout.", "When you retire from baseball, you have until the day you die to rest.", "Chicks who dig home runs aren't the ones who appeal to me.", "I like things that other people don't have.
